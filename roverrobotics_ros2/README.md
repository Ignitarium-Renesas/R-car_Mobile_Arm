# ROS2 Driver for Rover Robots

  

## About:

  

- This package is being created to add necessary features and improvements for our robots, specifically for ros2. Our ros2 package has been lacking in regards to out-of-the-box support for items such as URDF, Simulation, Slam, and Navigation. This package aims to bring our ros2 up to speed with all of these features.

  

- This package is exclusively built for ROS2. It is being tested on Ubuntu 22.04 with ROS2-Humble.

  

- This is built on top of the old roverrobotics_ros2 driver. It is designed specifically to fix many reoccuring bugs that we faced with the old driver and implement new features.

  

- While this driver will constantly be changing on the main branch, we have released a stable humble branch! Stable releases will be released for their respective ROS2 version (I.e. Our packages for humble and that are stable are released into the humble branch of this repository).
